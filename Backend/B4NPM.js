// NPM >>> Node Package Manager

// npm contains lot of packages
// packages are the codes of people we can install and use it.

// command to verify the npm >>> npm


// Installing packages through npm
// command to install packages >>> npm install <package name>
// after installation of packages we get 3 things 1)node module directory 2) package-lock.json 3)package.json
// 1)node module >>>contains all the installed dependency .
// 2) package-lock.json  >>> it records the exact version of every installed dependency, including its sub-dependencies and their versions.
// 3) package.json (IMPORTANT)  >>> the package.json file contains descriptive and functional metadata about a project such as a name, version, and dependencies.
// NOTE :- If we have lost the node module directory than we can install it by the command >>> npm install


// If we are making our own project than to initialize the "package.json" we have to go inside the project file and use command >>> "npm init"
// We install packages in two ways :- 1) Globally (rarelly used) 2) Locally (Mostlly used)
