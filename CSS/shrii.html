                    <p>My dearest Shriii,</p>
                    <p>Across the miles and through the days, my love for you grows stronger with every heartbeat. The distance between us only serves to remind me of how much you mean to me, and how every moment spent apart is a moment yearning to be by your side.</p>
                    <p>Though we may not share the same physical space right now, know that you are always in my thoughts and in my heart. Your smile brightens my darkest days, and your laughter is the melody that keeps me going.</p>
                    <p>Every day, I cherish the memories we've made and eagerly anticipate the moments we will create together in the future. Until then, let our love bridge the gap between us, holding us close even when we're far apart.</p>
                    <p>With all my love,</p>
                    <p>Jay</p>
